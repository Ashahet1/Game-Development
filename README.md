# Game-Development
Lets add idea to different levels.
Purpose:  
a. Learn Visual Studio 2019 and adjust to GUI and integrated tools available.
b. Learn SFML library(easy to use gaming platform OpenGL) and setup a envornment within Visual Studio to use different classes, most easy to use some of the packages like Render Window, audio, sound and graphics, does not crash while using, my biggest concern while playing.
My first idea of is to create a Game called Timber who chopes of a log from the trunck of a tree and collect the team.
Design flow will be included and committed seperately for better understanding.
I wish to add few more levels, but need suggestion for it.
Keep it open for suggestion.
